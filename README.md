the web part of Graceful Chess
==============================

Made for University of Michigan's EECS 481.

Running HTTP server (Mac OSX):

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    open http://localhost:8000

Some notes:

- I didn't want a build step, so this thing makes too many HTTP requests and resources aren't minified. Sorry!
